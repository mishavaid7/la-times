Using these results, we then created a **classifier**, teaching the classifier which words were associated with simple assault compared to aggravated assault.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we used the classifier to **predict whether each assault was aggravated or simple assault**. If a crime was predicted as serious but marked as non-serious, it needed to be examined as a possible downgrade. Our algorithm correctly pointed out around **65%** of the randomly downgraded crimes."

    "* Our algorithm had 88% accuracy overall, but only 65% in detecting downgraded crimes. What's the difference here? How important is one score compared to the other?\n",
    "* We only hit around 65% accuracy in finding downgraded crimes. Is this a useful score? How does it compare to random guessing, or going one-by-one through the crimes marked as non-serious?\n",
    "* What techniques could we have used to find downgraded crimes if we didn't use machine learning?\n",
    "* Is there a difference between looking at the prediction - the 0 or 1 - and looking at the output of `decision_function`?\n",
    "* What happens if our algorithm errs on the side of calling non-serious crimes serious crimes? What if it errs on the side of calling serious crimes non-serious crimes?\n",
    "* If we want to find more downgraded cases (but do more work), we'll want to err on the side of examining more potentially-serious cases. Is there a better method than picking random cases?\n",
    "* One of our first steps was to eliminate all crimes that weren't assaults. How do you think this helped or hindered our analysis?\n",
    "* Why did we use LinearSVC instead of another classifier such as LogisticRegression, RandomForest or Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)? Why might we try or not try those?\n",
    "* You don't work for the LAPD, so you can only be so sure what should and shouldn't be a serious crime. What can you do to help feel confident that a case should be one or the other, or that our algorithm is working as promised?\n",
    "* In this case, we randomly picked serious crimes to downgrade. Would it be easier or more difficult if the LAPD was systematically downgrading certain types of serious crimes? Can you think of a way to around that sort of trickery?\n",
    "* Many people say you need to release your data and analysis in order to have people trust what you've done. With something like this dataset, however, you're dealing with real things that happened to real people, many of whom would probably prefer to keep these things private. Is that a reasonable expectation? If it is, what can be done to bridge the gap between releasing all of the original data and keeping our process secret?"
